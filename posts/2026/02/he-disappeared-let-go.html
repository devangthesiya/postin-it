            He grew up in Meghalaya, where the rain stayed longer than people did.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a boy, he learned early how to shrink himself without meaning to. School was not cruel in loud ways, but it was unkind enough — jokes that lingered, laughter that followed him down corridors, nicknames that reminded him he didn't quite belong.
          </p>

          <p>
            He wasn't beaten or chased.<br>
            He was something easier to target — slow to respond, uncomfortable with attention, unsure of where to place himself when eyes turned his way. He learned to laugh before they could laugh harder. He learned silence because silence attracted less notice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over time, invisibility felt safer than humiliation.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>
            Listening became easier than speaking. Helping became easier than asking. He learned that if he made himself useful, people stayed kinder. Not closer — just kinder.
          </p>

          <p>
            That habit followed him everywhere.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through school, then college, then into an economics degree chosen less out of passion and more out of the promise of stability. He worked hard, did well, built a life that looked respectable from the outside. A well-paying job, a routine, responsibilities that made him look settled.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inside, the same quiet continued.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>
            Friendships formed around him, never quite with him. He was the one people came to when they were breaking. He stayed awake reading messages meant for someone else's healing. He listened carefully, responded gently, stayed longer than necessary.
          </p>

          <p>
            When they healed, they drifted away, never realizing he had needed them long before they ever needed him.
          </p>

          <p>
            He never blamed them.<br>
            He assumed this was how things worked. Some people were meant to be held. Others were meant to hold.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>
            Work took him to another city, but the pattern didn't change. The streets were crowded, the evenings were not. His phone was full of contacts, yet empty of anyone he could call without a reason.
          </p>

          <p>
            He spoke to his family often. Smiled during video calls. Said work was "busy but good." Said he was "managing." When the calls ended, the room returned to its familiar silence, as if it had been waiting for him.
          </p>

          <p>
            He was lonely, and sometimes it broke through.<br>
            The tears didn't arrive dramatically — they came in silence, late at night, leaving him to wake up and pretend nothing had happened.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>
            He tried to change, slowly. Forced conversations. Awkward jokes. Invitations that stayed polite and distant. He watched people form connections effortlessly and wondered when it had become so difficult for him to be seen.
          </p>

          <p>
            All he wanted was simple — love, care, the comfort of someone staying.<br>
            And beneath that want lived a fear he never said out loud: what if one day, everyone forgot him?
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>
            One night, after work, he opened a blank page. He told himself it was nothing serious. Just a thought he wanted to test.
          </p>

          <p>
            He tried to write down the name of one person who would notice if he vanished for a week.
          </p>

          <p>
            The page stayed blank longer than he expected.
          </p>

          <p>
            He wondered if the problem had always been him, was he?
          </p>
