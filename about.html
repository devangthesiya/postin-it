            Hey there — I'm <strong>Devang Thesiya</strong>. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.
          </p>

          <p>
            I built <strong>Musing</strong> because I wanted a space that's entirely mine — no algorithms, no feeds, no engagement metrics. Just a quiet place to think out loud and share what I find interesting.
          </p>

          <h2>What you'll find here</h2>

          <p>
            A mix of everything, really. Long-form essays when something takes hold of my brain for long enough. Quick notes when I just need to get a thought down. Occasionally something technical, but mostly just observations about the world, work, and life in general.
          </p>

          <h2>The philosophy</h2>

          <p>
            This site is intentionally minimal. No tracking, no analytics, no cookies. Just words on a page. I think the best writing happens when you're not trying to optimize for anything other than clarity and honesty.
          </p>

          <p>
            If something here resonates with you, or if you just want to say hi — reach out on the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>. I'd love to hear from you.
