          <p>
            If you're reading this, welcome. You've stumbled into my little corner of the internet — a place I've carved out to think in public.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Musing?</h2>

          <p>
            I've always been someone who thinks better by writing things down. Not in a structured, polished way — more like thinking out loud and seeing where the thread goes. That's essentially what this site is: a place for musings.
          </p>

          <p>
            The name felt right. A musing is just a thought given room to breathe — personal, unfiltered, honest. Not meant to be perfect. Just meant to capture something before it slips away. That's the energy I want here.
          </p>

          <h2>What to expect</h2>

          <p>
            You'll find a mix of things here:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Essays</strong> — longer pieces where I work through an idea from start to finish</li>
            <li><strong>Short notes</strong> — quick thoughts, observations, things that don't need a thousand words</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed bags</strong> — sometimes a post is just a collection of loosely connected thoughts, and that's fine</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            There's no schedule, no content calendar, no editorial strategy. I write when something needs to be written. Sometimes that's every day; sometimes it's once a month.
          </p>

          <h2>How this site works</h2>

          <p>
            This is about as minimal as a website gets. Plain HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript. No frameworks, no build tools, no dependencies to break. Every post is just an HTML file sitting in a folder organized by date.
          </p>

          <blockquote>

          </blockquote>

          <p>
            There's no tracking, no analytics, no cookies. I have no idea how many people read this, and I kind of like it that way. It keeps the writing honest — I'm not optimizing for clicks or engagement, just for clarity.
          </p>

          <h2>A small ask</h2>

          <p>
            If something here makes you think, or if you disagree with something I've written, I'd genuinely love to hear about it. The best ideas come from conversation, not monologue. You can find me on the <a href="../../../contact.html">contact page</a>.
          </p>

            That's it for now. Thanks for being here. Let's see where this goes.
